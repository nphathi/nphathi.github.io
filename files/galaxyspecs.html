<title>Typical Spectrum of a Bright Elliptical</title>
<H2> Absorption line  galaxies</A></H2>
<P align=justify>
Elliptical galaxies are dominated by an old, evolved stellar population, where
all of the massive, bright and blue main sequence stars have died out,
and have therefore red colours.
They have a very low fraction of cold gas (but can have extended hot,
X-ray emitting gas)  and typically exhibit little  evidence of star formation.
Most of them show no detectable emission lines at all, although
faint <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img19.gif"> and <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img20.gif">  can
be detected.
<P align=justify>
Elliptical galaxies show relatively homogeneous spectra,
dominated by absorption features from cool giant stars like
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img21.gif">, Na D <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img22.gif">,
Ca II K <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img23.gif"> and Ca II H <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM
ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img24.gif">.

NGC 4889 in Fig. 1 shows the typical spectrum of a bright elliptical. 
As a class the spectra of S0 galaxies are nearly indistinguishable
from those of the elliptical galaxies and for both Hubble types 
the denomination early-type galaxies is commonly used.

<P align=justify>
A typical feature of early-type galaxies is the discontinuity in their
spectral energy distribution around 4000 &#197;.  This is due to the
sudden onset of stellar photospheric opacity shortward of 4000 &#197;,
to the Fraunhofer H and K lines of CaII and to a variety of elements
heavier than helium in various stages of ionization.  This
discontinuity is called <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img26.gif"> break index and can be simply
visualized as the ratio of the mean fluxes in two windows above and
below 4000 &#197;:
<br><br>
<IMG  ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img27.gif"><br><br>

where <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img28.gif"> is the flux in erg <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM
ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img29.gif"> and 
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img30.gif"> &#197;, <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img31.gif"> &#197;,
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img32.gif"> &#197;,<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img33.gif"> &#197;.
<P align=justify>
This index is insensitive to  changes in metal abundance
and to the absolute magnitude of the galaxies and
its mean value for nearby early-type galaxies is 2.1<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img34.gif">0.1
with a well defined upper envelope value of <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img35.gif"> 2.3.
<P align=justify>
If  the galaxy has a significant star formation
the young and hot stars present  will increase the flux in the ultraviolet
spectral region below 4000 &#197; causing thus a decrease the <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img36.gif">
break index. 
This sensitivity to the presence of young stars explain why
this index has much lower values in   spirals and generally
correlates with the galaxy Hubble type  and
 with emission features  indicative of recent star formation
(blue colors, <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="../graphics/img37.gif"> emission etc..).
