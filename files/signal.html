<h1>
Signal Versus Noise
</h1>

<p>
There are a number of factors which affect the quality of
photometry of star in a CCD image.
One is the exposure time: the longer the exposure time,
the higher the signal in a star, and so the more precise
the measurements.
Of course, if one exposures too long, one will saturate the 
CCD, which ruins the measurements.
But how long an exposure time is necessary?

<p>
The answer depends on your goal.
If you simply want to verify that 
an object is present at a particular location,
you may accept a very faint, barely noticeable dot of light.
If you want to measure the position of 
an asteroid to an arcsecond, you would need
a little more signal.
If you want to make a very rough estimate
of magnitude, to ten percent, say, then
you might need more signal.
And if the goal is to look for tiny variations
in light of a variable star, you might need
to expose long enough that the star comes
close to the non-linear regime.

<p>
So how can you figure out the appropriate exposure
time for a given project?
There are two approaches:


<p>
<ol>
<li> Consider this exchange from <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>:
  <blockquote>
  (the family car drives past a sign, "Bridge Load Limit: 10 Tons")
  <br>
  <b>Calvin:</b> Dad, how do they figure out the load limit for a bridge?
  <br>
  <b>Dad:</b> Well, they build a bridge, and then drive heavier and
                 heavier trucks over it until the bridge collapses.
                 Then they re-build the bridge.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  You can do exactly the same thing with your astronomical observing:
  take a series of images with increasing exposure times, and 
  measure the object of interest on each one.  
  The shortest exposure which provides enough precision for your
  goal is the right length.

  <p>
  This actually isn't a bad idea if you have huge amounts of 
  observing time.  On the other hand, if you are given just a single
  night on a big telescope, you probably won't want to waste any
  time taking a series of pictures, most of which turn out to be
  useless.

<p>
<li> Calculate the <b>signal</b> from your object for a set of
  exposure times.  There will be a number of different 
  sources of <b>noise</b> in the image -- determine the amount
  of noise from each and add them up.
  The ratio of <b>signal-to-noise</b> (S/N) yields the uncertainty
  in the measurement of stellar brightness:
  <pre>

                                     1
      fractional  uncertainty  =   -----
                                    S/N
  </pre>
  So, for example, if the S/N ratio is 50, the photometry will 
  have an uncertainty of 0.02, which is approximately 0.02 magnitudes.
</ol>

<h4>
Source of signal
</h4>
<p>
There is only one source of signal from a star:
the light of the star itself.
If the star causes <b>N(star)</b> photons 
to strike the CCD chip during the exposure,
and all of them knock free one electron,
then the image should have <b>N(star)</b> electrons.
That's the signal.


<p>
For the standard astronomical passbands,
there are equations which 
give the number of photons per second
collected by a telescope of a particular size
from a star of a particular magnitude.
A good source of these zero-point fluxes is
Allen's <i>Astrophysical Quantities</i>.
Some additional references are collected at the end of today's lecture.
I use these values:
<pre>
  Passband     photons/sec/cm^2 
              from star of mag 0
---------------------------------
    U            550,000
    B            391,000
    V            866,000
    R          1,100,000
    I            675,000
</pre>

<p>
<blockquote>
  Exercise:
  <ol>
  <li> How many photons should strike a CCD in a
           15-second exposure with the RIT telescope through the V filter
           of a star with magnitude V=13?

<h4>
Sources of noise
</h4>
<p>
There are three main sources of noise for simple
aperture photometry on a CCD:
shot noise from the star itself,
shot noise from the background,
and readout noise from the CCD.
Let's consider each in turn.

<p>
<ol>
<li> <b>Noise from the star:</b>
    The star produces photons in a random Poisson process,
    so that there are random variations in the number of 
    photons which strike the chip each second.
    The size of these random variations is simply the
    square root of the number of photons:
   <pre>

        noise(star)  =  sqrt of number of photons from star

                     =  sqrt[ N(star) ]
   </pre>

<p>
<li> <b>Noise from the background:</b>
    In aperture photometry, one adds up the light from all the pixels
    within an aperture; that light is a combination of photons
    from the star and photons from the sky near the star.
    One then subtracts the contribution from the sky within
    the aperture, leaving only the light from the star.

    <p>
    However, just as the number of photons from a star varies randomly
    according to Poisson statistics, so does the number of photons
    from the sky.  
    There is always some uncertainty in the amount of background
    light subtracted from the aperture.
    The noise due to this random variation is 
   <pre>
        noise(sky)   =  sqrt of number of photons from sky

                     =  sqrt[ N(sky)  ]
   </pre>

    We can break this down a bit further: to calculate the sky
    contribution, we determine a local sky level per pixel,
    and then multiply by the number of pixels within the aperture.
   <pre>
            N(sky)   =  (electrons per pixel from sky) * (number of pixels)
   </pre>
    So we can write the noise from the sky as
   <pre>
        noise(sky)   =  sqrt[ N(sky per pixel) * npix ]
   </pre>

<p>
<li> <b>Readout noise in the CCD:</b>

    The CCD electronics do not measure perfectly the amount of
    charge in each packet of electrons.
    They add a little bit of noise as they perform the 
    measurement process.
    Astronomers call this <b>readout noise</b>,
    and always express it in units of electrons.
    One can measure it by looking at a very short dark image:
    calculate the standard deviation of counts in a 
    box of 20x20 or 30x30 pixels, then multiply by the gain
    of the chip:
   <pre>
                                           electrons 
      readnoise R    =  stdev(counts)  *  ------------
                                             count 
   </pre>
    <p>
    In our calculations of signal-to-noise, we need to convert
    from the stdev to the corresponding variance:
   <pre>
        variance     =  (stdev * stdev)
   </pre>
    and then add up the variance from all the pixels which fall
    inside the photometric aperture.  The result is
   <pre>

     noise from CCD  =     (R*R)  * npix
   </pre>

</ol>

<p>
We can add all three sources of noise together: 
the way to do it is to add up all the electrons they produce,
and then again appeal to Poisson statistics to find
the noise.
<pre>
    total noise      =   sqrt [ N(star)  +  N(sky)*npix  +  (R*R)*npix  ]
</pre>

<h4>
Calculating Signal to Noise Ratio
</h4>
<p>
In order to find the S/N ratio, we simply divide the total signal
by the total noise.

<pre>
        signal                         N(star)
        ------  =   -------------------------------------------------
         noise       sqrt [ N(star)  +  N(sky)*npix  +  (R*R)*npix  ]
</pre>
where
<pre>
          N(star)           is the number of electrons from the star
                                   which fall within the aperture
 
          N(sky)            is the number of electrons per pixel
                                   due to the sky background

          R                 is the readout noise, in electrons

          npix              is the number of pixels in the aperture
</pre>
