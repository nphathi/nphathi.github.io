<u><h4>Galaxies at Intermediate Redshifts (z=1-3)</h4></u> 
<UL>
<LI> The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope
  (HST) has better ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity and
  resolution than previous space based UV instruments.
  Recently, I have been using high sensitivity UV imaging from the
  WFC3 with existing deep HST/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) optical images
  to identify UV-dropouts, which are Lyman break galaxy (LBG) candidates 
  at z=1-3.  I apply Lyman break dropout color selection
  criteria to identify LBGs at z~2, which requires
  space-based observations to identify redshifted Lyman break (rest
  912&Aring, observed 2700&Aring) at z~2 due to the atmospheric cut-off. We have
  large samples of LBGs at z>3 so the goal is to compare  properties of
  lower redshift LBGs with their higher redshift counterparts and
  understand their formation and evolution. I have studied 
rest-UV luminosity functions and SED analysis of these LBGs at z~2 with
possible evolutionary trends with redshifts.

<u><h4>Galaxies at High Redshifts (z=4-8)</h4></u> 
<UL>
<LI> At higher redshifts, I have used ACS optical data from the Hubble
  Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) to investigate structural properties of
  fainter LBGs at z=4-6. It is very difficult to study these faint
  galaxies individually so we stack large number of similar looking compact galaxies 
 at similar redshifts to infer their average structural
  properties. Some of the brighter LBGs at z=5-6 in the HUDF are
  spectroscopically confirmed using the ACS low-resolution grism data. 
  I use this sample to understand their surface brightness
  properties including their sizes and rest-UV colors. Recently, I
  have been searching for luminous LBGs at z=6-7 using wide
  ground-based surveys. If confirmed, such luminous candidates could
  shed light on their physical properties as well as their formation
  mechanisms. (ref: Hathi et al. 2008, AJ, 135, 156, Hathi et
  al. 2008, ApJ, 673, 686,  Hathi et al. 2012, ApJ, 757, 43)
