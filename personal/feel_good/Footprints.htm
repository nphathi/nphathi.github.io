<h3><center><u>FOOTPRINTS</u></center></h3>

One night a man had a dream. He dreamed he was walking
along the beach with the LORD. Across the sky flashed scenes from his life. For
each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand; one belonged to him,
and the other to the LORD.
<p>
When the last scene of his life flashed before him, he
looked back at the footprints in the sand. He noticed that many times along the
path of his life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that it
happened at the very lowest and saddest times in his life.
<p>
This really bothered him and he questioned the LORD about
it. “LORD, you said that once I decided to follow you, you’d walk with me all
the way. But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life,
there is only one set of footprints. I don’t understand why when I needed you
most you would leave me ?
<p>
The LORD replied, “My precious, precious child, I love
you and I would never leave you. During your times of trial and suffering, when
you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you.”</p>
