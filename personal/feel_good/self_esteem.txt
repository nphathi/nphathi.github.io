Self-confidence is a way of acting and living. It is knowing who you
are, what qualities you have, what you like, need, desire etc. It is
also having the competence to deal with people and situations, knowing
when and how to get help and to find solutions. It is about taking
care of yourself in all areas. It is something we can learn to have.

Self-esteem is – “A set of amorphous feelings about how much we like,
value and approve of ourselves”.  Our self-esteem is created by what
took place in our childhood within our family, community and culture
and the things we have gone through as adults and how we felt about
them. Our self-esteem is rooted in our feelings…which change day to
day and change with our enviroment. We can go through a rough time and
feel, due to guilt or the remarks of others, that we are not valued
and not worth much. We then tend to ‘not like’ ourselves, lowering our
self-esteem. — Paisley Goddess


Self esteem is who you think you are,
Self confidence is who you know you are!
