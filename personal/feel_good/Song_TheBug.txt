Artist: Carpenter Mary Chapin
Song: The Bug
Album: Come On, Come On


Sometimes you're the windshield
sometimes you're the bug
Sometimes it all comes together, baby
Sometimes you're just a fool in love
Sometimes you're the Louisville Slugger...  
Sometimes you're the ball
Sometimes it all comes together
Sometimes you're gonna lose it all...
