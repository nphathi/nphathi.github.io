“Hoping for the best, prepared for the worst, and unsurprised by anything in between.” ― Maya Angelou



** waqt se pahle aur kismat se jyada na kisi ko mila hai na kisi  ko milega

** 'maan ka ho toh acha hai .. aur na ho toh jyada acha hai'
(then it happens because of god's will and he always has our best interest)
God always gives us what we 'deserve' 
and not necessarily what we 'desire'

** Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets.
So, love the people who treat you right and forget about the ones who don't.
And believe that everything happens for a reason
if you get a chance - take it;
if it changes your life - let it.
Nobody said that it would be easy
They just promised it would be worth it.

** Life is the most difficult Exam.
Many people fail because they try to copy others -
Not realizing that everyone has a different question paper!

"Liberals keep telling me the Titanic is sinking but my side of the ship
is 500 feet in the air."
