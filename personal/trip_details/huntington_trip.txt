# Details about 'trip' to Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, CA (18-22 July, 2012) 

** visited Dr. Prema (OBGYN) at 11am on 18th July -- from her routine
   check-up everything was fine and it was now wait-and-watch period

** came back home at 12.30pm -- took lunch

** visited Dr. DeVore (fetal expert) for routine check-up at 1.30pm

** after check-up he recommended to go to hospital for delivery as
   amnio fluid index (AFI) was 2.4cm (low) -- it was 13cm on 9th July
   -- medically it is called oligohydramnios (exact cause is unknown)

** we called home and told mummy-pappa that we are going for check-up
   at hospital and will see what they say

** around 3-3.30pm we went to Huntington hospital and Purvi was
   admitted in Labor and Delivery ward -- they started monitoring
   baby's and Purvi's progress/vitals

** around 4pm called Dr. Prema and she recommended that we need to go
   for C-section because Purvi had no dilation (cervix was not open)
   so it might take 2 days for induced labor and that might not be
   good for baby with low fluid level -- also it was already 38 weeks
   so time was right

** we decided to go for C-section which can be performed only after
   ~8hours from your last meal so it was scheduled for ~8pm on 18th
   July

** informed Abad and all -- I went home at 5pm and told mummy-pappa --
   got other stuff for hospital and came back at 6pm

** after paperwork and surgery preparation (which included me wearing
   doctor like cloths) Purvi was taken in the OR at ~8.10pm. I was
   told to wait outside while they started adminstaring local
   anesthesia

** at about 8.35pm I was called inside the OR to see the surgery and
   doctors started the procedure -- Purvi was awake and after about 20
   minutes at 8.53pm baby boy (Harshil) was born !!!

** after initial checkup (weight, height etc) nurses allowed me to cut
   the remaining umbilical cord and gave me the baby to hold while
   doctors completed the surgery.

** Purvi spent 2-3 hours in the recovery room while baby was taken to
   nursery for detail check-up -- call to India, congratulations
   started to pour-in

** at around 10.30-11pm we moved to a private room 117

** first 12-24 hours Purvi was on IV, pain killers, catheter, leg pump
   etc and on total bed rest with no food or water

** after 12 hours ... water, juice allowed and after 24 hours normal
   food

** baby was in nursery until pediatrian (Dr. Lakshmanan) came on 19th
   at 11am

** after that baby was always with us except when they needed to do
   some tests or give vaccine -- mom, dad, baby had computer coded
   wrist bands for identification

** it took few hours for baby's heart rate to become normal and couple
   of days to start eating properly

** mummy-pappa visited 3 days otherwise stayed at home -- food from
   home or cafeteria/starbucks

** we stayed in the hospital until 22nd afternoon -- both are
   recovering normally

** overall huntington hospital stay was very good -- staff, nurses,
   facilities were very good and helpful

** some nurses were Skye, Susy, Jenal, Anita, Samira, etc it was
   interesting to see that even if shift changed every 12 hours all
   nurses knew everything about Purvi and baby through computer
   records ..and they were well prepared before coming

** it is just amazing to see the progress baby makes each day ....
