** Lessons learned so far **

* Never apply for a job to a place you don't want to go!
* Never carry too much luggage with you -- if needed, ship it! (it is
  cheaper and you don't have to carry)

** First reactions (not good) **

Communication!! 
Compared to US -- dirty, smaller roads/spaces
No (very few) public restrooms in the city area
Metro stations are not stroller friendly
Zero work during lunch hours (~1 to ~1.5 hours)
Lot of public smoking
Very slow in paperwork 
Overall expensive -- 1.5&euro;/litre petrol 

** First reactions (good) **

Public transport - quick and on time
Direct debit of rent (and other utilities)
RIB -- all bank related info on one page
ATM gives change e.g., 5,10,20... :-)
