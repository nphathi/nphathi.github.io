PNH: 17th to 29th
** Visited Priyanshu's play group, Reading town center, Birmingham Balaji temple,
Gloucester (Pratichi's Masi's place), Potters Bar (Rakshit's place), search for new apartment 


Edinburgh/London -- very quiet, lush green country side feel,
windy-cool or cloudy-warm weather each day, long days (5am to 9pm),
narrow roads, fewer trash cans, feels like indian traffic, historic
buildings -- many since 1500s, public toilets cost 20-30 pence for
each use, nice restaurants (Italian, Indian, Mexican, Spanish etc),
can see most of the sightseeing places in 2-3 days, overall nice
people, good experience and very enjoyable stay.  Staying and spending
time with Bhuvan, Pratichi and Priyanshu was great -- London trip was
hectic but memorable
