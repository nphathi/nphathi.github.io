* Main highway A8/E80 connects several European countries.

* Highways are very nice -- speed limit around 110 to 130 km/hr.

* Frequency (~every 20 kms) and quality of rest/service areas is very
  good -- we stopped at AVIA

* Visited La Croisette (famous street where festival is held) at
  Cannes -- walk/road along the ocean.

* Parking at Cannes cost 20 Euros (instead of 6 Euros) becoz of bad
  machine and cheat person.

* Drove thru Promenade des Anglais (road along the coast) and visited
  Montee du Chateau/Castle Hill (Park, Lookout point) at Nice.

* Lunch-cum-dinner at Indian Restaurant in Nice -- bought some grocery
  at Monoprix.

* Parking at Nice -- somebody broke front side small passenger window.

* Because of broken window, return drive was slow as cool wind could
  come in -- temp dropped to 10-11C --- will cost ~300 Euros extra


** Lessons learned

* In France and other countries buy full insurance while renting a car
* In parking machines, start with smaller currency notes (so if it
  does not work you don't loose much)
