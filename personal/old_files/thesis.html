		<b>Abstract</b> :		
<P align=justify style="margin-right : 2.5cm;">
		The abundance of iron, magnesium, calcium and sodium
		in the Alpha Centauri A were determined from the strong lines
		of these elements having well developed damping wings, using 
		the theory of collisional line broadening of alkali and other
		spectral lines by neutral hydrogen developed by Anstee & O'Mara
		(1991, MNRAS, 253:549-560) and the spectrum synthesis program
		of <a href="http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/people/ross/">Dr. John Ross</a>
		. The abundances in Alpha Centauri A are approximately 0.2 dex higher
		than in the Sun. The derived abundance is 
		indepedent of non-thermal motions in the photosphere of Alpha
		Centauri A. 
<P align=justify style="margin-right : 2.5cm;">
                The microturbulence (non-thermal motions) was then
		derived from the medium-strong lines of iron by fixing the 
		abundance of iron obtained from strong lines of iron and 
		adjusting the microturbulence to match the observed equivalent
		widths of each line. The microturbulence obtained from medium-strong 
		is 1.34 +/- 0.12 km/s, i.e., 0.20 km/s larger than in the Sun, which is fully consistent
		with the lower surface gravity of Alpha Centauri A. This
		microturbulence can then be used to
		determine the abundance of the elements which have no strong
		lines in the spectrum.</p>
<P align=justify style="margin-right : 2.5cm;">
		This method was first time used for Alpha Centauri A. The major
		problem of using these strong lines for abundance determination
		in the past was lack of suitable empirical or theoretical
		damping constants. The tables of line broadening cross-sections
		from Anstee & O'Mara (1995, MNRAS, 276:859-866) for s-p,p-s
		transitions helps to obtain damping constants. Anstee, O'Mara
		& Ross (1997, MNRAS, 284:202-212) have shown that with good
		f-values for a selection of strong lines it is possible to 
		produce solar iron abundance that is consistent with meteoritic
		abundances.</p>
