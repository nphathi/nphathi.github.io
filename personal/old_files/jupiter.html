<h4>
<LI>5th Planet in order of distance from the Sun</LI><P>
<LI>Largest planet in the solar system</LI><P> 
<LI>2.5 times the mass of all other planets</LI><P>
<LI>One/first of the jovian (gaseous) planets (4 inner terrestrial rocky planets)</LI><P>
<LI>Equatorial diameter 88,730 miles (1,42,800 kms)</LI><P>
<LI>Polar diameter 1,33,500 kms</LI><P>
<LI>Volume 1300 times that of the earth (1319 earths)</LI><P>
<LI>Mass 1.9 * 10^24 tons (~1.9 * 10^30 grams equivalent 317 earth masses)</LI><P>
<LI>Average density very much less compared to the earth approx. 1300 kg/m^3 (only 1.33 times the density of water and a quarter that of the earth)</LI><P>
<LI>Elliptical orbits at mean distance from the Sun as 778 million kms (778,329,000 kms) which is 5.2  astronomical units.</LI><P>
<LI>Moves at 13 km/sec in its orbit...takes 11.9 yrs to complete one orbit</LI><P>
<LI>Jupiter spins on its axis faster than any other planet... rotational period of 9 hrs 50 min 30 sec (remarkable for a body of such a size)</LI><P>
<LI>A point on Jupiter's equator spins at speed of  35000 km/hr. such speed makes planet flattened at poles and bulging at equator</LI><P>
<LI>Its rapid rotation and low density suggest that Jupiter is not a solid planet like the earth but a  fluid body</LI><P>
<LI>Small telescopes reveal a regular pattern of light and dark zone belts running parallel to Jupiter's equator usually yellow to reddish brown in color. Large instruments show a wealth of fine details which can change in a few hours. The relative prominence of various belts varies over a period of years, while the region around the south equatorial belt can undergo sudden and rapid changes i.e. darkening & developing many dark and light patches & spots. Detail photographs taken by Pioneer space craft in 1974 and 1975 show that equatorial regions are remarkably devoid of fine structure but consists instead of large scale swirls & plumes of cloud formed bcoz of rapid rotation.</LI><P>
<LI>The most remarkable feature on Jupiter and its only permanent surface marking is the RED spot discovered in 1665 (by Cassini). Before that observation made by Robert Hooke 1664 refers to the feature small temporary red spots have been seen at high latitudes. At some times it is darkest feature on the planet being reddish in color while at some other times it becomes virtually invisible and leaves a white hollow in its place.</LI><P>
<LI>Historical records show that the GRS was at its largest in 1880's but it has shrunk to a length of about 26,000 kms (about half its former value) It's width has remained fairly constant at about 14,000 kms  (3 small white ovals close to south temp belt)</LI><P>
<LI>Jupiter is remarkable in that it emits almost twice as much heat as it receives from the Sun. This may be heat left over from its formation. There is  a strong Greenhouse effect which  keeps the temperature of the upper atmosphere at about 120 to 138 K at both equator and pole even on dark side of the planet.<P>
(Greenhouse effect : The warming of a planet by its atmosphere short wave length radiation such as visible light reaches the surface of the planet which warms up and radiates heat. Some of this heat is absorbed by the atmosphere which acts as an insulating blanket around the planet. The effect is same as in a green house e.g. without an atmosphere the temperature of the earth would be about -30 C rather than the average 16 C observed)</LI><P>
[Atmosphere of Venus is mostly carbon dioxide a strong heat absorber. this along with some traces of water vapour produces unusually high temperature on Venus in what is sometimes termed as runaway green house effect]<P>
<LI>The deeper parts of the atmosphere are probably stagnant with turbulence and weather occurring only in the top 40 to 50 miles. Water condenses to form clouds at low levels, ammonia condenses at intermediate levels and methane forms the highest clouds.</LI><P>
<LI>The voyager results have confirmed the belief that the composition of the Jupiter is very similar to that of the Sun - roughly 90 percent hydrogen and 10 percent helium with very minor amounts of other elements and compounds. It is believed that the gaseous envelope of hydrogen compounds extends down to a depth of about 1000 kms below the cloud tops. Both pressure and temperature increases with depth. At this level is planet wide ocean of liquid hydrogen. The pressure at this depth would be about 5600 atm (1 atm = the pressure of earth's atmosphere at sea level) and temp would be in the region of 1700 C. At depth of about 25,000 km, pressure is 3 million atm and 12000 C the liquid molecular hydrogen then reverts to its liquid 'metallic' state. In this form hydrogen behaves rather like a metal in that it can conduct electricity.</LI><P>
<LI>It is believed that there is a rocky core at the center of Jupiter, with mass of may be 15 times the mass of earth. The metallic hydrogen zone is thought to extend down  to this core where temperature is about 30,000 C and pressure reaches 100 million atm. The acceleration due to gravity at the visible surface of Jupiter is 2.6 times that at the surface of the earth. This factor has prevented much of the planets primordial atm from leaking away into the space, so the composition of the planet has not radically changed since its formation 4700 million years ago. Never the less the heat that Jupiter pours out into space is thought to be derived from the gradual contraction of the planet.</LI>
