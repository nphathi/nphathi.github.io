<p class="title"><h3>Astronomers Use MMT Telescope To Detect Origin of Gamma-Ray Bursts</h3></p>
<p CLASS="byline">Friday, 18 April 2003<br>Lori Stiles</p>
<p class="bodytext" align=justify> Astronomers who include several from Arizona early this month 
used the 6.5-meter <a href="http://www.mmto.org">MMT</a> telescope on Mount Hopkins near Tucson 
to get the first direct evidence that powerful gamma-ray bursts come from exploding stars, or 
supernovae. <br><br>NASA's High-Energy Transient Explorer satellite initially detected one of 
the brightest and closest gamma-ray bursts ever seen, on March 29. The burst, about 2 billion 
light years away in the constellation Leo, outshone the entire universe in gamma rays for a 
full 30 seconds. Its optical afterglow remained a trillion times brighter than the sun two 
hours later.<br><br>Astronomers at the <a href="http://www.mmto.org">MMT</a>, which is jointly 
operated by the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Institution, revised their early 
April observing schedules to catch the afterglow of the burst. They saw spectra of a supernova 
emerge as the afterglow faded, clinching the case that at least some gamma-ray bursts are 
triggered in star explosions. <br><br>The origin of gamma-ray bursts has been a long-standing 
mystery. Brief, incredibly intense bursts of gamma radiation coming from unknown sources beyond 
our solar system were first detected in the late 1960s by U.S. military satellites deployed for 
nuclear test surveillance, said UA astronomer Daniel J. Eisenstein.<br><br>
Gamma-ray bursts are hard to study because they occur at random, and few last more than a 
minute. Great energy from the burst lights up the surrounding gas, creating the optical 
afterglow, but it is very faint because the bursts are so distant, typically 10 billion light 
years away. Earth's biggest, most powerful optical telescopes would be needed to monitor such 
distant afterglows, Eisenstein said.<br><br>Eisenstein, Edward W. Olszewski and graduate 
student Janice Lee of the UA Steward Observatory are among the astronomers who got data on 
the very recent, relatively close gamma-ray burst using the MMT. <br><br>The NASA satellite 
detected the burst early morning March 29, and that night Lee was observing with Steward 
Observatory's 2.3-meter Bok telescope on Kitt Peak. She was recruited to observe the burst 
afterglow, "by far the brightest afterglow ever detected at that late a time and nearly 
brighter than all events detected within seconds of a burst," she said.<br><br>"Not knowing 
what would develop, I put aside my own thesis project and gladly took an observation of the 
interesting-sounding object," she said. She also contributed some of her observing time at 
the MMT to study spectra of the gamma-ray burst afterglow on April 3.  <br><br>"There have 
been very tantalizing studies over the past few years that suggest gamma-ray bursts and 
supernovae are related," Olszewski said.<br> <br>Olszewski was at the telescope at the right 
time.  He observed the event beginning around 8 p.m. for three nights, from Monday, April 7, 
through Wednesday, April 9.  On Monday night, light from the afterglow had dimmed sufficiently 
that light from the brightening supernova began to shine through. <br><br>
"We could see the supernova rising out of the gamma-ray burst. For this object, it was the 
smoking gun that the gamma-ray burst and supernova are intimately related," Olszewski said. <br><br>

"For the first time, we were measuring an event no other human being had seen before," said 
Krzysztof Stanek of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who recruited nearly two 
dozen scientists to observe the burst, primarily on the MMT. "The MMT was our magic time 
machine that we used to capture this catastrophic cosmic event," Stanek said.<br><br> 
Lee said that as the news spread that the team was detecting a supernova hidden in the 
afterglow, "I became extremely excited. I felt very fortunate to be involved in this major 
discovery. It's all complete serendipity." <br><br>
Ironically, when Lee became a graduate student at Steward four years ago, she and her advisor 
during a brainstorming session briefly considered the origin of gamma-ray bursts as a possible 
dissertation topic. <br><br>"I felt it was an intractable question for one graduate student to 
tackle, since the project would require the cooperation of more than a dozen astronomers all 
over the country. So in the end, I took on a different thesis project."<br><br>"The really 
important thing is that the MMT got this campaign together. A whole group of people dropped 
what they were doing to monitor this event in the hopes that it would shed light on the 
gamma-ray burst – supernova link," Olszewski said. "It really has for this one. It is almost 
certain that whatever caused the gamma ray
burst also led to the supernova."<br><br>
Until 1997, most of what astronomers knew about gamma-ray bursts was to expect one such event 
per day from a random location in the sky, Eisenstein noted.<br><br>The 
<a href="http://bepposax.gsfc.nasa.gov/bepposax/">BeppoSAX</a> satellite launched in 1997 
located gamma-ray bursts precisely enough for astronomers to point ground-based optical 
telescopes at these bursts and study the faint optical afterglows, he added. That's how 
astronomers learned they were seeing enormously powerful gamma-ray bursts coming from the 
far distant universe, not relatively less energetic bursts close by, he said. <br><br>Stanek 
and collaborators reported the new results last week on
the <a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0304173">Astrophysics preprint server </a>and 
submitted a paper to Astrophysical Journal Letters.<br><br>
Arizona State University astronomer Rogier Windhorst, and <b>Nimish Hathi</b>, Rolf  Jansen and Luis 
Echevarria of ASU also used the MMT in this campaign. </p>
