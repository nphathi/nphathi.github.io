<b>100 billion brown dwarfs</b><br>
Brown dwarfs may rival the number of all normal stars in our galaxy.<br>

After decades of searching, astronomers discovered the first definite brown 
dwarf only 10 years ago. Now, a new analysis of Hubble Space Telescope data 
implies our galaxy has almost as many of these failed stars as it does normal 
stars like the Sun.<br><br>The Sun and most other stars power themselves by 
converting hydrogen into helium. In contrast, brown dwarfs have so little 
mass &mdash; less than 8 percent of the Sun's &mdash; they never get hot 
enough to sustain this nuclear reaction. Instead, they convert gravitational 
energy into heat, glowing red, then fade as they cool.</p>

Russell Ryan, Jr., <u>Nimish Hathi</u>, Seth Cohen, and Rogier Windhorst of 
Arizona State University used data from the Hubble Space Telescope to 
search for brown dwarfs in 15 different directions above and below the 
Milky Way's plane. By utilizing near-infrared data, the astronomers 
found 28 faint stars as red as those with the coolest spectral types, 
L and T. The stars ranged in brightness from magnitude 21 to 25.</p>

<p align='justify'>The brown-dwarf candidates belong to the thin disk, 
the galaxy's brightest component, which harbors the Sun and most other 
nearby stars. The thin disk is about 2,000 light-years thick; the 
brown-dwarf candidates are in a disk that's 2,280 &plusmn; 
330 light-years thick.</p>

Extrapolating from the number of brown dwarfs they discovered, Ryan 
and his colleagues estimate the galaxy has roughly 100 billion L- and 
T-type dwarfs. This number is comparable to the Milky Way's total of 
all other stars put together.<br><br>Thus, several brown dwarfs probably 
lurk unseen within just 12 light-years of the Sun. This volume of 
space contains more than two dozen main sequence stars like the 
Sun &mdash; but only two known brown dwarfs. Both these brown dwarfs 
orbit the orange dwarf star Epsilon (&epsilon;) Indi, which is 11.8 
light-years from Earth. They are the closest known brown dwarfs to 
the Sun.<br><br>Despite their impressive number, brown dwarfs add 
little weight to the galaxy and do not account for its dark matter. 
Ryan's team estimates brown dwarfs contribute roughly a billion 
solar masses to the Milky Way &mdash; only 0.1 percent of the galaxy's 
total. Altogether, the galaxy has roughly a trillion solar masses, 
most of which is dark matter.</p>

<p align='justify'>Ryan and his colleagues will 
publish their work in a future issue of <I>Astrophysical Journal 
Letters.</I></p>
