hi, my name is hirav vachharajani, oh... so you
know me as danny boy !! yes, I remember my mama 
gave my intro to you fellows when I came. At that 
time I couldn't write but now I can hit some computer

Now I am 5 months old and I can sleep, play with
my "little" sister manushi and I also try to sleep
with face down but I cannot roll that much bcoz
of my..., bcoz of my...  weight hi hi hi.
