<center><h3><u>NASA Helps Link Gamma Ray Burst &amp; Supernova</u></h3></center>

</p>

<p>
<img src="graphics/GRB030329_kyoto.jpg" width="210" ALIGN="LEFT">

<p align=justify>Scientists have discovered one of the brightest and closest
gamma 
  ray bursts on record is also a supernova. They obtained the 
  first direct evidence linking these two types of explosive phenomena, both 
  triggered by the death of a massive star.<br>
NASA's High-Energy Transient Explorer satellite (HETE) initially 
  detected the burst on March 29, 2003, in the constellation Leo. 
  For more than 30 seconds, the burst outshone the entire universe 
  in gamma rays, and its optical afterglow was still more than a trillion 
  times brighter than the sun two hours later.<br>
Through observations of the gamma ray burst afterglow, astronomers 
  spotted the telltale signs of a supernova. Scientists cannot yet 
  determine which came first, the burst or the supernova, but the 
  same event, a star explosion, was certainly the trigger for both.<br>
&quot;There should no longer be doubt in anybody's mind that gamma 
  ray bursts and supernovae are connected,&quot; said Dr. Thomas Matheson 
  of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), Cambridge, 
  Mass., and a member of the team that made the discovery.</p>

<p align=justify>Matheson's colleagues include Dr. Peter Garnavich of Notre Dame 
  and Dr. Krzysztof Stanek of the CfA. Nearly two-dozen scientists, 
  primarily using the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) at Mount Hopkins, 
  Ariz., obtained the data. Several of the MMT spectra were taken 
  by <b>ASU</b> graduate students <b>Nimish Hathi</b> and <b>Luis 
  Echevarria</b> and postdoc
  <b>Rolf Jansen</b> in <b>Rogier 
  Windhorst's</b> cosmology group. When the burst was discovered, 
  astronomers scheduled to use the MMT agreed to observe it as a target 
  of opportunity in collaboration with Garnavich, Matheson and Stanek.</p>

<p align=justify> Gamma ray bursts are the most powerful explosions in
  the universe, and they likely signal the birth of black holes. Bursts
  occur at random locations scattered across the sky. Few last more than
  a minute, making them hard to study.<br>
A supernova is the explosion of a star at least eight times
  as massive as the sun. When such stars deplete their nuclear fuel, 
  they no longer have the energy to support their mass. Their cores 
  implode, forming either a neutron star or, if there is enough mass, 
  a black hole. The surface layers of the star blast outward, forming 
  the colorful patterns typical of supernova remnants.<br>

Previous observations, particularly from NASA's Chandra X-
  ray Observatory, have provided convincing indirect evidence
  of the gamma ray burst/supernova connection. The Chandra Observatory 
  detected iron and other heavy elements, which are formed in supernovae, 
  in the vicinity of gamma ray bursts.</p>

<p align=justify>Matheson and the others detected direct evidence the
  burst afterglow's
  light is exhibiting the same patterns as light from a supernova. 
  Namely, the scientists see changes in light absorbed by silicon 
  and iron atoms, forged in the supernova, as the afterglow slowly 
  fades away. The team is continuing to observe and analyze this unique 
  burst.<br>
&quot;Scores of observatories, and even more observers, are now 
  studying this event,&quot; said Dr. Donald Kniffen, at NASA Headquarters 
  in Washington. &quot;We've been searching for a direct link for 
  decades, and we finally got it,&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;All gamma ray bursts may have associated supernovae that
  are too faint to observe,&quot; Matheson said. The March 29
  burst, named GRB 030329, was one of the closest to Earth. It was 
  approximately two billion light-years away, as opposed to other 
  bursts located more than 10 billion light-years away. Because the 
  burst was both relatively close to Earth and bright, the supernova 
  was detectable.</p>
